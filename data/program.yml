    bio: "Aaron Turon (aturon) is a member of the Rust Core Team and employed by Mozilla Research. His main focus in Rust is language design, libraries, and project management. Prior to joining Mozilla, Aaron received his PhD from Northeastern University, with a focus on language and library design around lock-free data structures and other low-level concurrency concerns. His work won the John C. Reynold's award for outstanding dissertation in programming languages. He also worked with Derek Dreyer on correctness proofs of lock-free data structures, developing an early technique for doing so on top of the C11 memory model."

trainings:
  - title: "Rust for Beginners"
    speakers: steve
    timeslot: morning
    slug: beginner
    focus: "Rust Fundamentals: Ownership and Borrowing"
    abstract: "Learn everything you need to get started writing Rust programs. The tutorial puts a focus on Ownership and Borrowing, which are the key techniques that Rust uses to achieve both safety and low-level performance.</p><p>This class assumes no prior knowledge of Rust, though programming experience in some other language would be helpful."
  - title: "Traits and Threads"
    speakers: aaron
    focus: "Traits and Threads"
    timeslot: morning
    slug: intermediate
    abstract: "Move up a level in Rust knowledge. This tutorial introduces the second key piece of Rust, its trait system. It shows how the trait system is the foundation for generic programming in Rust, allowing you to write one piece of code that can be reused in many contexts. It also covers how to write threaded programs in Rust, and shows how threaded programming in Rust builds on the trait system to guarantee data-race freedom.</p><p>This tutorial assumes basic understanding of ownership and borrowing; if you have been writing Rust for a while, you should do fine."
  - title: "How to think in Rust"
    speakers: nrc
    focus: "Mental models and design patterns"
    timeslot: afternoon
    slug: think
    abstract: "Learning a new programming language is hard. Even after mastering the syntax and type system, learning the libraries and techniques can take years. If you've read or written Rust and want to improve, this talk will give you a turbo boost! This will be a very practical tutorial, aimed at taking your Rust programming to the next level. We'll teach some core Rust design principles by covering a few key topics in depth. This tutorial is aimed at those with some Rust experience, but if you're a total beginner, you'll still learn a lot about what Rust programming is like in practice.<br><br> The tutorial will start with programming 'in the small': we'll explore some key library types (Option, Result, and Iterator) and cover practical error handling. Putting these together we'll see how to structure your control flow to write clear, succinct programs. We'll then cover some larger-scale design issues - using ownership as a primary architectural principle, and abstraction using traits. <br><br> You'll learn how to be more productive in Rust by writing clean and idiomatic code. You'll learn to work with the language rather than fighting against it."
  - title: "Futures and Async Programming"
    speakers: mgattozzi
    focus: "Futures, Tokio, and async programming in Rust"
    timeslot: afternoon
    slug: futures
    abstract: "Get started with understanding Asynchronous code in Rust! Whether you've just started using Async or you've been using it from it's inception there is something for everyone here. It'll show how to use the new async/await syntax, pinning api, and how to effectively leverage Futures in your Rust code. This class assumes you already have an understanding of how Rust works for the most part."
  - title: "WebAssembly"
    speakers: steve
    focus: "WebAssembly"
    timeslot: afternoon
    slug: wasm
    abstract: "TBD"
  - title: "RustBridge"
    speakers: ashley
    focus: "Intro to Rust and Hands-on Workshop"
    timeslot: full
    slug: rustbridge
    abstract: "This free workshop is for people who are members of groups that are underrepresented in tech, in the style of RailsBridge. There will be a morning introduction to Rust concepts and an afternoon hands-on project. This class assumes no prior knowledge of Rust, but familiarity with any other programming language, the command line, and a text editor is recommended."
